This is my personal site where I showcase web applications I have made. I'm making these apps for practice and fun :)
You can view this site at willtan.tech.


List of web apps:
1. Christmas Wishlist Sender - PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascipt, JQuery
	- Users can enter what they want for christmas in a dynamic form.
	- Dynamic form meaning they can click a button to create more input elements.
	- Once submitted, form is sent to PHP backend and an email is generated and mailed to the recipient detailing the wishlist.
